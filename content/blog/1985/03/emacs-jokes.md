title: Emacs笑话
---

Richard M. Stallman (RMS,因创造EMACS而被熟知) 正在写一个UNIX克隆叫做GNU (意思是Gnu's Not Unix--a recursive
acronym). 

这似乎为整个 gnu 类笑话开辟了道路。 比如：

<!--more-->

> Q:  不穿衣服黑客的人叫什么？ 
> A:  裸体主义者。

> Q:  您如何称呼合格的年轻黑客？ 
> A:  Gnubile。

> Q:  黑客最喜欢的糖果是什么？ 
> A:  Gnugat。  (虽然它含有很少的营养。)

> Q:  充满空气的计算机叫什么？ 
> A:  Gnumatic。

> Q:  一直缠着你问愚蠢问题的新手黑客怎么称呼？
> A:  一个gnuisance。

> Q:  What do you call a subtle, clever hack in the favorite language?  
> A:  A gnuanCe.

> Q:  What do you use a supercomputer for?  
> A:  Gnumerical analysis.

> Q:  What do you call a hacker who collects coins?  
> A:  A gnumismatist.

嗯，还有更多，只是太多了，无法一下子说完，我想。

EMACS belongs in <sys/errno.h>: Editor too big!

EMACS may stand for "Editing MACroS," but some friends of mine
suggested some more creative definitions. Here they are. Anyone have
any additions?

## ed forever?

When I log into my Xenix system with my 110 baud teletype, both vi
*and* Emacs are just too damn slow.  They print useless messages like,
'C-h for help' and '"foo" File is read only'.  So I use the editor
that doesn't waste my VALUABLE time.


```
ED(1)               UNIX Programmer's Manual                ED(1)

NAME
     ed - text editor

SYNOPSIS
     ed [ - ] [ -x ] [ name ]
DESCRIPTION
     Ed is the standard text editor.
```

Computer Scientists love ed, not just because it comes first
alphabetically, but because it's the standard.  Everyone else loves ed
because it's ED!

"Ed is the standard text editor."

And ed doesn't waste space on my Timex Sinclair.  Just look:

```
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root          24 Oct 29  1929 /bin/ed
-rwxr-xr-t  4 root     1310720 Jan  1  1970 /usr/ucb/vi
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  5.89824e37 Oct 22  1990 /usr/bin/emacs
```

Of course, on the system *I* administrate, vi is symlinked to ed.
Emacs has been replaced by a shell script which

     1) Generates a syslog message at level LOG_EMERG;
     2) reduces the user's disk quota by 100K; and
     3) RUNS ED!!!!!!


"Ed is the standard text editor."

Let's look at a typical novice's session with the mighty ed:

```
golem> ed

?
help
?
?
?
quit
?
exit
?
bye
?
hello?
?
eat flaming death
?
^C
?
^C
?
^D
?
```

---
Note the consistent user interface and error reportage.  Ed is
generous enough to flag errors, yet prudent enough not to overwhelm
the novice with verbosity.

"Ed is the standard text editor."

Ed, the greatest WYGIWYG editor of all.

ED IS THE TRUE PATH TO NIRVANA!  ED HAS BEEN THE CHOICE OF EDUCATED
AND IGNORANT ALIKE FOR CENTURIES!  ED WILL NOT CORRUPT YOUR PRECIOUS
BODILY FLUIDS!!  ED IS THE STANDARD TEXT EDITOR!  ED MAKES THE SUN
SHINE AND THE BIRDS SING AND THE GRASS GREEN!!

When I use an editor, I don't want eight extra KILOBYTES of worthless
help screens and cursor positioning code!  I just want an EDitor!!
Not a "viitor".  Not a "emacsitor".  Those aren't even WORDS!!!! ED!
ED! ED IS THE STANDARD!!!
